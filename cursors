---------------------Cursors----------------------------------------

A Cursor in PostgreSQL is used to process large tables. Suppose if a table has 10 million or billion rows. While performing a SELECT operation on the table it will take some time to process the result and most likely give an “out of memory” error and the program will be terminated.

A Cursor can only be declared inside a transaction. The cursor does not calculate the data but only prepares the query so that your data can be created when FETCH is called. In the end, simply commit the transaction.

DECLARE 
    [cursor_name] CURSOR FOR [query]
    
After declaring a cursor, we can get the data using FETCH. The FETCH gets the next row(s) from the cursor. If no row found, then it returns NULL.

FETCH [direction (rows)] FROM [cursor_name];

where direction can be empty,
number of rows you want or one of the following:
