Here are the main types of constraints available in PostgreSQL:

1.NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
2.UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
3.PRIMARY KEY: A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
4.FOREIGN KEY: Ensures the referential integrity of the data in one table to match values in another table.
5.CHECK: Ensures that the value in a column meets a specific condition.
6.EXCLUSION: Ensures that if any two rows are compared on the specified column or expression, at least one of these comparisons will return false or null.
